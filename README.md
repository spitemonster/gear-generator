# Gear Generator

Yet another TTRPG utility. The game in question is set in a post-apocalyptic world where anything useful is hard to come by, particularly weapons. As such, I devised a fairly simple and elegant system for randomly generating in-game weapons from various components, lending the weapon certain features or capabilities and limiting others. This is very much a video game looting inspired utility. Given a bunch of options in various JSON files, this, on load, creates some number of cards populated by randomly generated weapons. The weapon components are not evenly distributed; this takes into account certain things being more rare than others.

## Build and Run

`git clone https://github.com/spitemonster/gear-generator.git`

`cd gear-generator`

`npm install`

Open the HTML file in your browser, or host it and the `dist` folder on a server of your choice.

## Roadmap

This is effectively done; it did its job well, but given that the game is on hold as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, this sees little use.
